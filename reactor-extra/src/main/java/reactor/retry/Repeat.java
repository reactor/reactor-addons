/**
 * Repeat function that may be used with {@link Flux#repeatWhen(Function)},
 * {@link Mono#repeatWhen(Function)} and {@link Mono#repeatWhenEmpty(Function)}.
 * <p>
 * Each change in configuration returns a new instance (copy configuration), which
 * makes {@link Repeat} suitable for creating configuration templates that can be fine
 * tuned for specific cases without impacting the original general use-case configuration.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre><code>
 *   repeat = Repeat.times(10)
 *                  .randomBackoff(Duration.ofMillis(100), Duration.ofSeconds(60))
 *                  .withApplicationContext(appContext)
 *                  .doOnRepeat(context -> context.applicationContext().rollback());
 *   flux.repeatWhen(repeat);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * @apiNote Repeat can be directly created with a maximum number of attempts, yet there
 * is a {@link #repeatMax(long)} method to change that post-construction, for the case
 * where one wants to fine tune that aspect for specific use-cases. For instance, the
 * default configuration could be an unlimited amount of attempts ({@link Long#MAX_VALUE})
 * with a global {@link #timeout(Duration)}, but for some specific cases you might want
 * to change both the timeout and limit the attempts.
